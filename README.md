# Embroidery Supplies Manager

Embroidery Supplies Manager is a multi-page app for hobbyists to track their inventory, plan projects, and check which materials they still need to buy. Users manage their own supplies and projects, while admins can manage categories and user roles.

## Project status

The project foundation, database schema and RLS migrations, email/password authentication, supply browsing, and supply CRUD are implemented:

- Vite multi-page app scaffold complete
- Bootstrap and shared styling configured
- Initial schema created in `supabase/migrations/`
- Row-level security policies added for profiles, user roles, categories, supplies, projects, and project items
- Security helper `public.is_admin()` added for admin-only writes
- Supabase auth client, login/register screens, session-aware navigation, sign-out, and route guards
- Protected supplies browsing with category filtering, search, sorting, and loading/empty/error states
- Supply create/edit forms and confirmed deletion from the inventory list

Live integration checks still need to be completed against the configured Supabase project, including writes and cross-user ownership. The next feature milestone is supply photo storage.

## Planned technology

Vanilla JavaScript ES modules, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, Vite, and Supabase (Postgres, Auth, and Storage).

## Local development

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

To build the production bundle, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

The app reads Supabase credentials from `.env`. Configure the project URL and browser-safe anon/publishable key before testing auth.

### Supabase integration smoke tests

1. Start the app with `npm run dev` after configuring `.env`.
2. Open `/pages/register.html`, create an account, and follow the email confirmation link if confirmation is enabled in Supabase Auth.
3. Log in at `/pages/login.html`; verify the navbar shows the signed-in email and a sign-out button.
4. Sign out and verify guest navigation returns.
5. While signed out, visit `/pages/supplies.html`; verify it redirects to login and returns to the requested page after sign-in.
6. As a signed-in user, verify categories and only that user's supplies appear. Repeat with a second account to confirm data isolation.
7. Add a supply, edit it, cancel a delete confirmation, then confirm deletion. Verify quantity/color validation and visible errors.

The default-category seed is a migration under `supabase/migrations/`; apply pending migrations to the intended Supabase project before expecting seeded categories to appear. Never share or commit `.env` values.

## Next implementation milestone

Add private supply-photo uploads with storage policies, file type/size validation, and cleanup when images are replaced or supplies are deleted. See [the implementation plan](docs/implementation-plan.md).

## Roles

- User: manages their own supplies and projects
- Admin: full access plus category and role management
