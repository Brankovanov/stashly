# Embroidery Supplies Manager

Embroidery Supplies Manager is a multi-page app for hobbyists to track their inventory, plan projects, and check which materials they still need to buy. Users manage their own supplies and projects, while admins can manage categories and user roles.

## Project status

The project foundation, database security layer, and email/password authentication flow are implemented:

- Vite multi-page app scaffold complete
- Bootstrap and shared styling configured
- Initial schema created in `supabase/migrations/`
- Row-level security policies added for profiles, user roles, categories, supplies, projects, and project items
- Security helper `public.is_admin()` added for admin-only writes
- Supabase auth client, login/register screens, session-aware navigation, sign-out, and route guards
- Protected supplies browsing with category filtering, search, and sorting in progress

Live authentication still requires configured Supabase credentials and a running project. The next implementation focus is supplies and project CRUD.

## Planned technology

Vanilla JavaScript ES modules, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, Vite, and Supabase (Postgres, Auth, and Storage).

## Local development

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

To build the production bundle, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

The app reads Supabase credentials from `.env`. Configure the project URL and browser-safe anon/publishable key before testing auth.

### Authentication smoke test

1. Start the app with `npm run dev` after configuring `.env`.
2. Open `/pages/register.html`, create an account, and follow the email confirmation link if confirmation is enabled in Supabase Auth.
3. Log in at `/pages/login.html`; verify the navbar shows the signed-in email and a sign-out button.
4. Sign out and verify guest navigation returns.
5. After the protected supplies page is available, visit `/pages/supplies.html` while signed out; verify it redirects to login and returns to the requested page after sign-in.

## Roles

- User: manages their own supplies and projects
- Admin: full access plus category and role management
