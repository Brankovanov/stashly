# Embroidery Supplies Manager

Embroidery Supplies Manager is a multi-page app for hobbyists to track their inventory, plan projects, and check which materials they still need to buy. Users manage their own supplies and projects, while admins can manage categories and user roles.

## Project status

The project foundation is in place and the database security layer has been added in the latest migration:

- Vite multi-page app scaffold complete
- Bootstrap and shared styling configured
- Initial schema created in `supabase/migrations/`
- Row-level security policies added for profiles, user roles, categories, supplies, projects, and project items
- Security helper `public.is_admin()` added for admin-only writes

The next implementation focus is authentication and protected page flow, followed by supplies and project CRUD.

## Planned technology

Vanilla JavaScript ES modules, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, Vite, and Supabase (Postgres, Auth, and Storage).

## Local development

```sh
